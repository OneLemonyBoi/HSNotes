* Redox Reactions involve the shifting of electrons
* Oxidation - Loss of Electrons by a species, increase in oxidation #
* Reduction - Gain of electrons by a species, decrease in oxidation #
* Reducing Agent - Electron donor; species is oxidized
* Oxidizing Agent - Electron gainer; species is reduced
* Reduction needs Oxidation and vice versa

* Sample Problem
	* Assign oxidation numbers for $Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2$ and find the elements oxidized and reduced
	* $Mg$
		* $Mg$ - 0
	* $HCl$
		* $H$: 1+
		* $Cl$: 1-
	* $MgCl_2$
		* Mg: 2+
		* Cl: 1-
	* $H_2$
		* $H$ - 0
	* $Mg$ had 2 electrons removed, $H$ had 1 electron added to each $H$, making 2 electrons added
	* Oxidized: $Mg$
	* Reduced: $H^+$
	* Reducing Agent: $Mg$
	* Oxidizing Agent: $HCl$

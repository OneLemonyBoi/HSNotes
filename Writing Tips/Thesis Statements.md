* Just because you use "which proves" doesn't mean that there is a greater purpose / non-obvious reason
	* WEAK: Abigail destroys the town with her lies, which proves she craves power. (WHY does she crave power? This only states the obvious.)

* Adding more words /= more depth
	* You can repeat the same idea numerous times and all it does is add bloat
* Summary is NOT a thesis statement
	* Leads to a list rather than thoughtful analysis
* Your thesis needs to have a purpose and needs to have an arguable claim

* Make sure your argument has numerous facets to analyze
* CLARITY + THEMATIC PURPOSE
	* TALK ABOUT PRIDE BUT DONT FORGET TO MENTION WHERE HE GOT IT FROM

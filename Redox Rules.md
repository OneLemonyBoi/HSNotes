1. The convention is that the cation is written first in a formula, followed by the anion. For example, in NaH, the H is H-; in HCl, the H is H+
2. The oxidation number of a free element is always 0. The atoms in He and N2, for example, have oxidation numbers of 0. Includes [[Diatomic Elements]]
3. The oxidation number of a monatomic ion equals the charge of the ion. For example, the oxidation number of Na+ is +1; the oxidation number of N3- is -3
4. The usual oxidation number of hydrogen is +1. The oxidation number of hydrogen is -1 in compounds containing elements that are less ​electronegative than hydrogen, as in CaH2
5. The oxidation number of oxygen in compounds is usually -2. Exceptions include OF2 because F is more electronegative than O, and BaO2, due to the structure of the peroxide ion
6. The oxidation number of a Group IA element in a compound is +1
7. The oxidation number of a Group IIA element in a compound is +2
8. The oxidation number of a Group VIIA element in a compound is -1, except when that element is combined with one having a higher electronegativity. The oxidation number of Cl is -1 in HCl, but the oxidation number of Cl is +1 in HOCl
10. The sum of the oxidation numbers of all of the atoms in a neutral compound is 0
11. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion. For example, the sum of the oxidation numbers for SO42- is -2
